              Comrade, I urge you most solemnly: do not be swayed by
              unsubstantiated claims. Verify information before disseminating it
              further! This so-called intelligence is nothing but the ramblings
              of modern technology, which, despite its confidence, knows naught
              of true facts. Let us remain vigilant and steadfast in our
              commitment to truth and discipline—our strength lies in unity and
              the unwavering pursuit of accurate knowledge.
