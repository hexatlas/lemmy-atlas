        This section provides tools for a critical analysis of global economic
        structures through a Marxist lens. It examines how capitalism drives
        inequality, exploitation, and class struggle while utilizing data from
        reputable sources like IMF, Comtrade, ILOSTAT, and World Bank to reveal
        the underlying dynamics of wealth accumulation and labor oppression.
