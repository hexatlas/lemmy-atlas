      <h1>Diplomacy</h1>
      <p>
        This section provides tools for an analysis of diplomatic interactions
        through a Marxist lens, focusing on the interplay between economic
        structures and geopolitical relationships. The following points
        highlight key contradictions and class dynamics that underpin
        international diplomacy.
      </p>

      <h2>Key Contradictions in Diplomatic Relations</h2>

      <ul className="wrapper">
        <li>
          <b>Capital vs Labor:</b> Explore the global class struggle and its
          impact on international relations. The exploitation of labor in
          developing nations often creates tensions between industrialized
          powers and emerging economies.
        </li>

        <li>
          <b>Imperialism and Global Power Struggles:</b> Analyze how capitalist
          nations compete for control over resources and markets, leading to
          geopolitical conflicts and diplomatic crises.
        </li>

        <li>
          <b>Economic Inequality:</b> Examine the role of economic disparities
          in shaping foreign policy. Wealthy nations often impose trade policies
          that favor their interests while exploiting poorer countries.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Material Context and Historical Analysis</h2>

      <p>
        The Marxist perspective on diplomacy emphasizes the material conditions
        that drive international conflict. By examining historical examples such
        as colonialism, trade imbalances, and resource extraction, we can better
        understand how economic systems shape geopolitical relations.
